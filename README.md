# YAII - Yet Another Interpreter Interpreter

This project is a tool which I am developing in order to be able to build a simple excel-like language for another project.

Thereby the code here is heavily mixed together with code needed for this language. This tool is just something which is useful for creating said language and may become it's own project in the future.

The main idea is to be able to interpret a given grammar and parse it. A general purpose lexer is not included, however a purpose build one for the excel-like language is.
